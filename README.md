Eclipse CodeMap plug-in
-----------------------

This Eclipse plug-in is a kind of low-rent [Mylyn] task editor.

- In Eclipse create a new *.codemap file and edit it.
- Right-click in the top panel and add a new entry
- Edit the entry's name and description in the middle panel
- Drag files that are related to the task from the Package Explorer to the bottom panel

*That's it! Simple and low-rent.*
